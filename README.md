# Petful Server

Developed by Tom Wallace Jr as a Thinkful project
Pair - SOLO

This application was built using 
Front end - Javascript, React JS, and vanilla CSS 
Back end - Node JS, Express, and Knex

# How This App Works
Petful is a fictionary pet adoption application that uses a 'First in first out' approach to adopting. The are two queues on the server side, one for cats and one for dogs. The user places their name onto a list, when it is their turn the next available cat and dog will display. Once the user decides which pet to adopt they will be taken to a confirmation page.
